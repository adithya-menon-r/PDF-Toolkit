# PDFwerks

**PDFwerks** is a lightweight yet comprehensive tool for working with PDFs directly from your terminal. It provides essential PDF manipulation tools all in one easy to use package

> **Why PDFwerks?**  
> Well, a few months ago, I needed to merge some important stuff like my Aadhaar and other IDs. I used the usual online tools, but it got me thinking, "Who even knows what happens to my files after I upload them?" That’s when I decided to build PDFwerks - a local tool that keeps your documents safe and under your control.
